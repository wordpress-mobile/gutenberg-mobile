# To get started with Dependabot version updates, you'll need to specify which
# package ecosystems to update and where the package manifests are located.
# Please see the documentation for all configuration options:
# https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/

# We are using two configurations so they run at a different time
# to avoid multiple PRs running CI and SauceLabs.
# Currently, there's a limitation with GitHub and multiple combinations of
# package-ecosystem, as a workaround one of them has a target-branch.
