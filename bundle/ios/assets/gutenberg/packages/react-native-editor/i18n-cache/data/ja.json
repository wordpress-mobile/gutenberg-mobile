This whole post is composed of <em>pieces of content</em>—somewhat similar to LEGO bricks—that you can move around and interact with. Move your cursor around and you&#8217;ll notice the different blocks light up with outlines and arrows. Press the arrows to reposition blocks quickly, without fearing about losing things in the process of copying and pasting.":["この新しいエディターのゴールは、WordPress へのリッチコンテンツの追加をシンプルで楽しくすることです。この投稿全体が<em>コンテンツのパーツ</em>—LEGO ブロックのようなもの—により構成されており、動かしたり操作できるようになっています。カーソルを動かすと、様々なブロックが枠線と矢印とともにフォーカスされます。矢印を押すとブロックをすばやく並び替えることができ、コピー & ペーストしているうちに内容が消えてしまう恐れがありません。"],"Of Mountains &amp; Printing Presses":["Gutenberg を試してみよう"],"Welcome to the Gutenberg Editor":["Gutenberg エディターにようこそ"],"Learn more":["さらに詳しく"],"Are you sure you want to unschedule this post?":["本当にこの投稿の予約を取り消しますか ?"],"The title for the object.":["オブジェクトのタイトル。"],"Unique identifier for the object.":["オブジェクトの一意識別子。"],"Untitled Reusable block":["無題の再利用ブロック"],"Small":["小"],"Reusable":["再利用可能"],"Add to Reusable blocks":["再利用ブロックに追加"],"Keep as HTML":["HTML として保持"],"The response is not a valid JSON response.":["返答が正しい JSON レスポンスではありません。"],"Editor publish":["エディターの投稿パネル"],"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/gutenberg/":["https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/gutenberg/"],"Support":["サポート"],"No comments to show.":["表示できるコメントはありません。"],"%1$s on %2$s":["%2$s に %1$s より"],"Select Post":["投稿を選択"],"Select Week":["週を選択"],"Select Day":["日を選択"],"Select Month":["月を選択"],"Select Year":["年を選択"],"Archives":["アーカイブ"],"Cyan bluish gray":["シアンブルーグレー"],"Vivid cyan blue":["鮮やかなシアンブルー"],"Pale cyan blue":["淡いシアンブルー"],"Vivid green cyan":["鮮やかなグリーンシアン"],"Light green cyan":["薄いグリーンシアン"],"Luminous vivid amber":["琥珀"],"Luminous vivid orange":["オレンジ"],"Vivid red":["レッド"],"Pale pink":["ピンク"],"Inline image":["インライン画像"],"Available block types":["利用可能なブロックタイプ"],"Transform to":["変換:"],"Remove block":["ブロックを削除"],"Open publish panel":["公開パネルを開く"],"Large":["大"],"Regular":["通常"],"File":["ファイル"],"Close dialog":["ダイアログを閉じる"],"Sorry, this file type is not permitted for security reasons.":["このファイルタイプはセキュリティ上の理由から、許可されていません。"],"Disable tips":["ヒントを無効化"],"Got it":["OK"],"See next tip":["次のヒントを見る"],"When you’re ready, submit your work for review, and an Editor will be able to approve it for you.":["準備ができたらレビューをリクエストしましょう。編集者が承認して公開できます。"],"Are you ready to submit for review?":["レビューをリクエストする準備ができましたか ?"],"Remove image":["画像を削除"],"Invalid term ID.":["無効なターム ID。"],"The ID for the parent of the object.":["親オブジェクトの ID。"],"Error while uploading file %s to the media library.":["ファイル %s をメディアライブラリへアップロード中にエラーが発生しました。"],"This file exceeds the maximum upload size for this site.":["このファイルはサイトの最大アップロードサイズを超えています。"],"View the autosave":["自動保存を表示"],"There is an autosave of this post that is more recent than the version below.":["以下のバージョンよりも新しい自動保存された投稿があります。"],"Autosaving":["自動保存中"],"beta":["ベータ"],"Pin to toolbar":["ツールバーに固定"],"Unpin from toolbar":["ツールバーへの固定解除"],"No results found.":["見つかりませんでした。"],"Error loading block: %s":["ブロック読み込みエラー: %s"],"Unknown error":["不明なエラー"],"term\u0004Remove %s":["%sを削除"],"%1$s (%2$s of %3$s)":["%1$s (%2$s/%3$s)"],"Remove item":["項目を削除"],"Color code: %s":["カラーコード: %s"],"Skip to the selected block":["選択したブロックをスキップ"],"Schedule…":["予約…"],"OK":["OK"],"Block settings closed":["ブロック設定の非表示中"],"Close plugin":["プラグインを閉じる"],"Editor settings":["エディター設定"],"Link settings":["リンク設定"],"Unlink":["リンク解除"],"Height":["高さ"],"Width":["幅"],"Image dimensions":["画像の寸法"],"Media Library":["メディアライブラリ"],"Advanced":["高度な設定"],"Add item":["項目を追加"],"Reset the template":["テンプレートのリセット"],"Keep it as is":["変更しない"],"The content of your post doesn’t match the template assigned to your post type.":["投稿の本文は投稿タイプに割り当てられたテンプレートと一致しません。"],"Resetting the template may result in loss of content, do you want to continue?":["テンプレートをリセットするとコンテンツが失われる可能性があります。続行しますか ?"],"Document Statistics":["文書の統計情報"],"is now scheduled.
