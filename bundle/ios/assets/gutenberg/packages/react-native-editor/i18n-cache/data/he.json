No need to figure out HTML tags, classes, or remember complicated shortcode syntax. That&#8217;s the spirit behind the inserter—the <code>(+)</code> button you&#8217;ll see around the editor—which allows you to browse all available content blocks and add them into your post. Plugins and themes are able to register their own, opening up all sort of possibilities for rich editing and publishing.":["למעשה, כל מה שאפשר לעשות ב-WordPress זמין לך לביצוע מהיר ונגיש ממקום אחד בממשק. אין צורך להבין איך להשתמש בתגיות HTML, בסיווגים או לזכור תחבירים מורכבים של שורטקוד. הרעיון מאחורי כפתור ההוספה – הכפתור <code>(+)</code> – הוא לאפשר לך לעיין בכל הבלוקים הזמינים לתוכן ולהוסיף אותם לפוסט שלך. תוספים וערכות עיצוב יכולים להכיל בלוקים מסוימים ולפתוח בפניך אפשרויות נוספות לעריכה ולפרסום של תוכן עשיר."],"The <em>Inserter</em> Tool":["כלי <em>ההוספה</em>"],"Try selecting and removing or editing the caption, now you don&#8217;t have to be careful about selecting the image or other text by mistake and ruining the presentation.":["אפשר לבחור את הכיתוב ולנסות להזיז או לערוך אותו. אין צורך לדאוג שייבחרו תמונות או טקסטים אחרים בטעות או שהתצוגה תיהרס."],"If your theme supports it, you&#8217;ll see the \"wide\" button on the image toolbar.
